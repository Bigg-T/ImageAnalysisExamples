<p>
A collection of matlab scripts illustrating different concepts in image analysis
The scripts are constructed for the 
<a href="http://www.ctr.maths.lu.se/course/newimagean/2016/"> 
basic course in image analysis.</a> at Lund University, Sweden.

The examples are intended to illustrate concepts and algorithms in the course. 
This means that most often
the algorithms are implemented in a way that resembles the equations or the theory. 
To get really efficient and robust algorithms, one often has to implement all kinds
of bells and whistles.

Such algorithms are often implemented in packages/modules/toolboxes for
different programming languages, e.g.
<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://opencv.org"> 
opencv for c/c++/python/java.</a>
<li>  <a href="http://se.mathworks.com/products/image/"> 
Image Processing Toolbox for matlab.</a>
</ul>

Suggestions and/or corrections are always appreciated. 
All data and scripts are open source and can be found at

<ul>
<li> <a href="html/gettingstartedwithimages.html"> 
Getting started with images.</a>.
A small example on how to load images, colors, coordinate systems. 
<li> <a href="html/interpolation1d.html"> 
One-dimensional interpolation example..</a> 
<li> <a href="html/interpolation.html"> 
Interpolating in images</a>
<li> <a href="html/histeqdemo.html"> 
Histogram equalization</a>
<li> <a href="html/localmaxblobs.html"> 
Finding blobs by smoothing followed by local maximum suppression 
and thresholdin
g.</a>.
Also with sub-pixel refinement. 
<li> <a href="html/edgeByGradient.html"> 
Finding edges by calculating gradient magnitude and angle from 
smoothed image.</a>.
However, without thresholding and non-maximum supression. 
<li> <a href="html/edgeByGradientWithNonMaximuSuppression.html"> 
Finding edges by calculating gradient magnitude and angle from 
smoothed image.</a>.
This time with thresholding, non-maximum suppression, sub-pixel 
refinement and linking edgelets together if they forme a low curvature curve. 
<li> <a href="html/linefitting_3_ways.html"> 
Three examples on how to fit a line to points in 2D.</a>
First least squares, then total least squares and finally using the 
singular value decomposition. 
<li> <a href="html/pcaGenerateFromBasis.html"> 
Using mean-image and eigen-images to generate synthetic images.</a> 
<li> <a href="html/pcaDemo.html"> 
Principal component analysis, i.e. how to calculate a mean image and a 
low-dimensional basis that capture most of the variation in the data .</a>
