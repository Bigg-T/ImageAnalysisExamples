# ImageAnalysisExamples
A collection of matlab scripts illustrating different concepts in image analysis
The scripts are constructed for the 
[basic course in image analysis](http://www.ctr.maths.lu.se/course/newimagean/2016/) at Lund University, Sweden.

Some of the scripts are meant to be interactive. By downloading the github project
you can try out the scripts. This is something we also experiment with in our
[interactive linear algebra book](http://www.immersivemath.com/.


Some of the scripts are also converted to html using 
the journal function in matlab, see 
[this homepage](http://www.ctr.maths.lu.se/matematiklth/personal/kalle/imageanalysis/).

The examples are intended to illustrate concepts and algorithms in the course. 
This means that most often
the algorithms are implemented in a way that resembles the equations or the theory. 
To get really efficient and robust algorithms, one often has to implement all kinds
of [bells and whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_and_whistles).

Such algorithms are often implemented in packages/modules/toolboxes for
different programming languages, e.g.
* [opencv for c/c++/python/java](http://opencv.org)
* [Image Processing Toolbox for matlab](http://se.mathworks.com/products/image/)

Suggestions or corrections are always appreciated.
