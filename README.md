# ImageAnalysisExamples
A collection of matlab scripts illustrating different concepts in image analysis

The examples are intended to illustrate concepts and algorithms in the course. 
This means that most often
the algorithms are implemented in a way that resembles the equations or the theory. 
To get really efficient and robust algorithms, one often has to implement all kinds
of [bells and whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_and_whistles).

Such algorithms are often implemented in packages/modules/toolboxes for
different programming languages
