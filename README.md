# ImageAnalysisExamples
A collection of matlab scripts illustrating different concepts in image analysis
The scripts are constructed for the 
[basic course in image analysis](http://www.ctr.maths.lu.se/course/newimagean/2016/) at Lund University, Sweden.

The examples are intended to illustrate concepts and algorithms in the course. 
This means that most often
the algorithms are implemented in a way that resembles the equations or the theory. 
To get really efficient and robust algorithms, one often has to implement all kinds
of [bells and whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_and_whistles).

Such algorithms are often implemented in packages/modules/toolboxes for
different programming languages, e.g.
* [opencv for c/c++/python/java](http://opencv.org)
* [Image Processing Toolbox for matlab](http://se.mathworks.com/products/image/)
