%% Toolbox with matlab scripts illustrating concepts of Image Analysis
% The scripts can be run as the are.
% But also try to run some scripts line by line or paragraph by paragraph
% and try to understand the different steps
% A third option is to run the scripts in 'publish' mode to 
% generate html files
%
% help ImageAnalysisExamples - see this help text
%
% gettingstartedwithimages - loading and displaying images, coordinates
% interpolation1d - interpolation of 1D signals
% interpolation   - interpolation equation $$ f(x,y)=\sum_{i,j}h(x-i,y-j)f(i,j), $$
% histeqdemo      - histogram equalization
% Feature detection
%  localmaxblobs   - blob-detection, first integer, then sub-pixel
%  edgeByGradient  - edge-detetion, integer position
%  edgeByGradientWithNonMaximuSuppression - same but 
%           with thresholding, non-maximum suppression, 
%           sub-pixel refinement and linking edgelets together.
% Fitting
%  linefitting_3_ways - Fit a line to points using three different methods
% 
% deep_learning_ocr_illustration - illustrates ocr with deep learning
% pcaDemo - example of principle component analysis
% pcaGenerateFromBasis - example of generating images from PCA-basis
% pcaGenerateFromBasisInteractive - same but interactive
